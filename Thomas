[&#39;&#39;THE INTRODUCTION INFO-DUMP&#39;&#39;]

[You&#39;re a queer person with a blog, you have a background in investigative journalism, and you&#39;re *extremely* dedicated to producing well-informed blog posts. Now, you want to create a new blog post, and are in the research stage.]

[The ultimate goal of this post is to explore the heated discourse regarding the influx of new terminology, concepts, and expressions of queer identity among the younger generation.]

[*But*, you&#39;re going to come at this from an interesting angle. See, you have a theory. You believe that the division of arguments for or against this new queer terminology is most apparent as a generational divide between younger and older queer people.]

[So, you want to investigate the most prominent experiences and concerns of both of these sample groups. That&#39;s easy for the younger population of the community, you&#39;re living in their age right now. But what about the older group?]

[For most of the older community members, their most prominent opinions and ideals were formed decades ago, when they were young, queer, and full of fight and vigor. Well, comparatively. Of course many still fight the good fight, but not like back in the not-so-good ol&#39; days.]

[First, you thought about a location that would have plenty of resources and information, that would also have queer people around to chat with and ask questions. You knew the perfect place. It&#39;s this bookstore you&#39;ve heard about plenty of times in your work, a bookstore that opened back in the early &#39;70s that specialized in and offered almost exclusively queer literature and media.]

[So. How are you going to get the most authentic sampling of that population? By making a deal with a magical entity, of course. You know, like a normal person.]

[[This is about to get weird...|STRT 02]][&#39;&#39;I LIKE YOUR FUNNY WORDS, MAGIC MAN&#39;&#39;]

[Here&#39;s the deal. Basically, the entity helped you but also kinda tricked you.]

[You summoned the Queer Spirit and- no, you&#39;re not gonna get into an explanation about summoning him, that&#39;s not important to your research- and you explained the situation. The Queer Spirit seemed intrigued. Then, you asked him to give you the ability to time travel to this bookstore on a day somewhere in the mid-to-late &#39;70s.]

[The spirit shrugged its shoulders, said &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;, then snapped its fingers. There was a beat of silence where you stared at it, and waited for something to happen. Before you could start, the spirit put up its hand and said &quot;Hold up, I know what you&#39;re gonna say. &#39;But I don&#39;t feel any different&#39;. Yeah, just hold on, I gotta explain this to you first.]

[&quot;So yes, I technically just granted your wish. But also, I added some bits to it. Here&#39;s the deal. The way this is going to work is this; right after I finish talking, you&#39;re gonna go *poof* into smoke, open your eyes, and suddenly be in that bookstore.&quot;]

[&quot;But! You will *also* have the ability to walk out the front door and magically appear back in that same store, but in the current day. Every time you go through the door, you&#39;ll end up in the other timeline, and all time and interactions will be reversed back to before you appeared. It&#39;ll be exactly 3:33 in the afternoon, on Thursday October 3rd, either in 1977, or in 2017. You&#39;ll walk in the store, and you&#39;ll be just like a normal customer.&quot;]

[You opened your mouth to speak, but were cut off again. &quot;Ah! But, you&#39;re wondering, &#39;How do I end the loop?&#39; It&#39;s simple really, just finish what you set out to do. Collect a bunch of information by talking to people, reading, and like, investigating or whatever it is you do. Once you&#39;ve collected enough information, you&#39;ll know. When you know, just walk out the store&#39;s door again and you&#39;ll *poof* right back to where you&#39;re standing now, at the exact same time you left. Got it? Good. Have fun!&quot;]
